WDB parsing module for netcdf-java.

<p>
This is an extension module for the 
<a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf-java/">netcdf-java</a> 
library, which allows reading wdb databases in a similar manner that you would 
a regular netcdf file.



<h1>Usage</h1>


<h2>Registering wdb with netcdf-java</h2>

In order to use this module with netcdf-java, you must register it in your 
program. More complete instructions can be found at the
<a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf-java/reference/RuntimeLoading.html">
netdf-java pages</a>, but a short summary is also provided here.

<p>
The simplest way to use wdb_netcdf, is to register it programatically 
somewhere before using the netcdf-java library, for example in your main 
method. This is done by performing the following static method call:

<p>
<code>
ucar.nc2.NetcdfFile.registerIOProvider(no.met.wdb.netcdf.WdbIOServiceProvider.class);
</code>   

<p>
It is also possible to specify this loading, using an xml file in a particular 
format. This allows for using wdb with programs, such as ToolsUI. See the 
netcdf-java documentation for details.


<h2>Locating database and specifying dataset</h2>

Since wdb is a database, there is no file to read to get the data. Instead, a 
wdb configuration file is used. This file specifies where to find the 
database. Optionally, the file may also specify restrictions on what data may 
be extracted from the database. The restriction works by specifying a wci.read 
query, and only those rows which are returned by that query becomes available 
to netcdf-java. Only parameters to wci.read that are specified in the file 
will be subject to restrictions.

<p>
The wdb configuration file should be in xml format. A schema for the xml can 
be found in the etc/wdb_query.xsd file of the wdb_netcdf package. Also, an example 
configuration file may be found in the test/ folder.


<h2>Global configuration</h2>

A global configuration file is provided in order to provide configuration 
which should be valid for every database. Here, translations between wdb- and
netcdf parameter names are provided. Also, a specification of what global 
attributes to include in every netcdf file is also provided. This is an xml 
file with a schema defined in etc/wdb_config.xsd. The default global 
configuration file may also be found in the same folder.

<p>
Normal users should never need to worry about the global configuration file.
