WDB parsing module for netcdf-java.

This is an extension module for the netcdf-java library, which allows reading 
wdb databases in a similar manner that you would a regular netcdf file.

See the overview.html file for information about usage of this library

See http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf-java/ for information about 
netcdf-java.


USAGE WITH THREDDS

In order to use this library with thredds
(http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/projects/THREDDS/) you need to observe
the following:

The files for WDB access are xml-formatted descriptions of where to
find data, instead of the actual data. However, the thredds sever
will throw weird errors at you if you give these files the suffix
.xml. It may be better to give these files the suffix .wdbml
(but any suffix apart from .xml should work just fine).

I order to make thredds support wdb, you must do the following:

1: Drop a wdb-netcdf-java.jar file, along with a postgresql driver
   (postgresql.jar) into the tomcat's
   $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/thredds/WEB-INF/lib/ (not
   $CATALINA_HOME/lib).

2: Add this line under the <nj22Config> tag in the file
   $CATALINA_HOME/content/thredds/threddsConfig.xml:

   <ioServiceProvider class="no.met.wdb.netcdf.WdbIOServiceProvider"/>

3: Modify $CATALINA_HOME/content/thredds/catalog.xml to give access to
   your files, as per the thredds documentation.
